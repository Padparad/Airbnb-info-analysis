# Airbnb-info-analysis

In our analysis of Airbnb listing prices, we employ a range of methods, including linear regression and PCA, to explore the intricate relationships between listing characteristics and pricing. Our findings underscore the significant impact of guest reviews on prices, while also revealing the multifaceted nature of pricing dynamics.

In our discussion, it becomes evident that there is room for improvement and the recognition of potential causal inference problems in our analysis. To enhance the robustness of our findings, several avenues for improvement can be considered. First and foremost, incorporating a more comprehensive set of variables, such as property size, location-specific factors, and seasonal trends, could provide a more complete picture of the factors influencing Airbnb listing prices. Additionally, exploring interaction terms between variables may unveil nuanced relationships. Ensuring data quality by addressing missing values is crucial, as missing data can impact the reliability of our analysis.

On the front of causal inference, selection bias, simultaneity, and omitted variable bias need careful consideration. Selection bias may emerge if our dataset is not randomly sampled, potentially skewing our results. Simultaneity problems could arise from bidirectional relationships between variables, requiring more advanced modeling techniques to address. Omitted variable bias, resulting from unaccounted-for factors, should be mitigated by incorporating a broader range of relevant variables into our analysis. In future work, applying advanced causal inference methods like instrumental variables or propensity score matching can help to untangle these complexities and strengthen our ability to draw more robust causal inferences about the determinants of Airbnb listing prices.
